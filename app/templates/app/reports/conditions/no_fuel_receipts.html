    <h6>Criteria</h6>
    <p>
        As contained in the Ghana Gazette August, 2004 part VIII (Cash Payment No.14) where applicable, official receipt 
        shall be obtained in support of payments to Departments, Enterprises and individuals, officers concerned in any

        attended, Fuel for Official Vehicle, Genset and others as shown in Appendix ‘K’ did not have fuel receipts to authenticate the payment.
    </p>

    <h6>Cause</h6>
    <p>
        These lapses could be ascribed to laxity on the part of the accounts department to obtain fuel receipts from the beneficiaries
        to acquit the Payment Vouchers
    </p>
    <h6>Effect</h6>
    <p>
        The authenticity of such transaction could not be ascertained. Again, the practice is a violation of financial rule and 
        discipline which could attract adverse audit observation.

    <h6>Recommendation</h6>
    <p>
        Management should as a matter of urgency impress on the accounts department to obtain those receipts from the beneficiaries to
        authenticate the payments failure which the amount should be refunded by the beneficiaries.
