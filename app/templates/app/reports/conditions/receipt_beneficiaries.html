    <h6>Criteria</h6>
    <p>
        Part II paragraph 39(2c) of F.A.R 2004 L.I 1802 requires that the head of   accounts section of a department shall control the 
        disbursement of funds and ensure that transactions are properly authenticated to show that amounts are due and payable.
        Also, Standard practices requires that payments made to individuals / staff shall be signed by each individual to show that monies 
        paid were dully received by them.
    </p>
        
    <h6>Condition</h6>
    <p>
        On the contrary, the Accounts Unit failed to ensure that individuals / staff sign for monies claimed to have been paid to them. 
        See Appendix ‘H’ for details.
    </p>

    <h6>Cause</h6>
    <p>
        These lapses could be ascribed to laxity on the part of the accounts department to ensure that beneficiaries signed for 
        monies received.
    </p>
    <h6>Effect</h6>
    <p>
        The authenticity of such transaction could not be ascertained and could also lead to staff not receiving monies due them.
    </p>
    <h6>Recommendation</h6>
    <p>
        We recommend that the Accountant should ensure that the payees append their signatures to authenticate the payments or such 
        monies refunded.
