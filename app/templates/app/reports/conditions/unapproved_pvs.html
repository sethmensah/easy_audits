    <h6>Criteria</h6>
    <p>
        Section D1: (Processing Payments, Statement of rules 3) of the ATF requires the Head of BMC to authorize Payment 
        Vouchers before payments are made.
    </p>
    
    
    <h6>Condition</h6>
    <p>A total of (94) Payment Vouchers totaling GH¢{{v}} were not authorized by the Head of the facility or 
person assigned (Hospital Administrator) to authorize before payments were made. Details shown in Appendix ‘I’.</p>

    <h6>Cause</h6>
        <p>The lapse was due to non-compliance with financial regulation regarding the disbursement of public funds.</p>
    <h6>Effect</h6>
        <p>This practice if not checked could lead to payments being made for goods and services not provided, resulting in a loss of funds to the {{data.facility_name | title}}.
Also, this practice casts doubt on the authenticity of the payments.</p>
    <h6>Recommendation</h6>
    <p>We recommended to management to have the payment vouchers appropriately certified and approved by the 
required officer of {{data.facility_name | title}} for our verification. Failing, the amount of GHc{{v}} should be surcharged to the Accountant.
