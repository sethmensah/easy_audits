    <h6>Criteria</h6>
    <p>
        Part II paragraph 39(2c) of F.A.R 2004 L.I 1802 requires that the head of   accounts section of a department shall control the disbursement
        of funds and ensure that transactions are properly authenticated to show that amounts are due and payable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Section D1: (Processing Payments, Procedures/Steps to Follow 1) of the AxTxF states that “the receipt of a certified SRA, 
        Activity and Expenditure Initiation Form and an Invoice from a certifying officer is essentially the first step in the payment process. 
        It is the responsibility of the Head of the Finance Office to review such underlining certifications for legitimacy and completeness 
        before approving the preparation of a Departmental Payment Voucher.
    </p>
            
    <h6>Condition</h6>
    <p>
        Paid Vouchers amounting to GH¢{{ v }} were not fully accounted for as shown in Appendix ‘D’.
    </p>

    <h6>Cause</h6>
    <p>
        This anomaly could be attributed mainly to the preparation of Payment Vouchers and/or withdrawing of cash without
        recourse to any underlining document. Also, direct spending from cash collection without banking and disregard to payment 
        procedures occasioned this anomaly.
    </p>
    <h6>Effect</h6>
    <p>
        The Payments could not be authenticated as there were no documents available for verification.
    </p>
    <p>
        This practice could lead to duplicate payments as the supporting documents could be used as acquittals for different payment vouchers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The internal control procedures which is to ensure the authenticity of payments are disregarded making such transactions questionable.  
    </p>
    <h6>Recommendation</h6>
    <p>
        Management should provide evidence of the amount not accounted for, for verification and authentication failure which 
        the amount be refunded by the Head Finance.
