    <h6>Criteria</h6>
    <p>
        Standard Practices and payment procedures required that before payments are effected there should be memos to 
        explain the activity and the purposes for which such payments should be made.
    </p>
            
    <h6>Condition</h6>
    <p>
        Payment vouchers amounting to GH¢{{ v }} were made by {{ data.facility_name | title }} to suppliers and individuals without memos
        to authenticate the transactions. Details in Appendix ‘J’.
    </p>

    <h6>Cause</h6>
    <p>
        This anomaly could be largely attributed mainly to the preparation of Payment Vouchers without recourse to any 
        underlining document and deliberate disregard to financial rules.
    </p>
    <h6>Effect</h6>
    <p>
        The Payments could not be authenticated as there were no documents available for verification.
    </p>
    <p>
        This practice could lead to duplicate payments as the supporting documents could be used as acquittals for different payment vouchers.
    </p>
    <h6>Recommendation</h6>
    <p>
        Management should produce the memos for audit scrutiny and authentication failure the amount be refunded by the approving, 
        authorizing authority and necessary sanction preferred against them.
