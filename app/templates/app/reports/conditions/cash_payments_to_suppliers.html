    <h6>Criteria</h6>
    <p>
        The Financial Administration Act 2003, Act 654 section 43 requires that payment shall be made only to the person or persons 
named on the payment voucher or to their representatives duly authorized in writing to receive the payment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regulation 48(2) of L.I. 1802 stipulates, "a head of department shall ensure, as far as it is consistent with the 
        convenience of the public and the control of transactions, that collections or payments are made by cheque, bank transfer or 
        direct payment to bank accounts".
    </p>
            
    <h6>Condition</h6>
    <p>
        On the contrary of this provision, the Head of Finance made several payments to suppliers, companies, artisans and
        individuals by combining various transactions whose cheques should have been written in the names of the companies, 
        artisans and individuals in the name of Medical Superintendent. Details as per Appendix ‘F’.
    </p>

    <h6>Cause</h6>
    <p>
        These lapses could be attributed to disregard for financial rules and discipline. The head of finance also attributed 
        it to the lack of proper documents and Bank Accounts on the part of the Artisans and some suppliers.
    </p>
    <h6>Effect</h6>
    <p>
        Cash instead of cheque payments in the settlement of the above obligation also raises doubt as to the actual beneficiary of 
        the amount paid. {{ data.facility_name | title }} could also attract adverse audit observations. 
    </p>
    
    <h6>Recommendation</h6>
    <p>
        We recommend that management should desist from this practices but however they should educate and encourage their 
        Artisans and suppliers to register and open Bank accounts for their businesses. Also the head of finance must adhere to 
        financial rules and disciplines. Failure which the amount should be surcharged against him as required by regulation 8.
