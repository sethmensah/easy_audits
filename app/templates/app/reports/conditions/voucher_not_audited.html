    <h6>Criteria</h6>
    <p>
        The Internal Audit Agency Act, 2003 Act 658 part II section 16(2) states that "there shall be appointed for each Internal Audit Unit, 
        personnel required to ensure an effective and efficient internal auditing of the MDA or MMDA concern";
    </p>
    <p>Also as required by D.1 (Processing Payments) under Expenditure Accounting and Control of the Ministry of Health – Accounting, Treasury and 
    Financial Reporting Rules and Instructions (ATF) and the Director Generals Directive (Ref. No. GXS/DGS/ G2), all payment transactions 
    are to be submitted to the Internal Audit Unit for pre-payment review before cheques are written and issued.</p>
    
    <h6>Condition</h6>
    <p>Contrary to this regulation , the head of finance made a total of (105) Payment Vouchers totaling GH¢{{v}}  paid between {{scope}} 
    which were not pre audited by the Internal Auditor of the {{ data.facility_name | title}} although records indicated the officer was at post before payments were made. Details shown in Appendix</p>

    <h6>Cause</h6>
        <p>The lapse was as a result of Accounts department and management non - compliance to the above regulation.</p>
    <h6>Effect</h6>
        <p>Failure to submit payment vouchers for pre–auditing before payments are made could lead to abuse in the management of resources of the facility. 
            Again this practice if not checked could lead to payments being made for goods and services not provided, resulting in a loss of funds to the {{ data.facility_name | title}}.</p>
    <h6>Recommendation</h6>
    <p>We therefore recommended that, in order to ensure effective and efficient management and control of funds,
 management should ensure that PVs are pre–audited before payments are made in compliance with the regulation.
