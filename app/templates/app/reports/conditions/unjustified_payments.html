    <h6>Criteria</h6>
    <p>
        Regulation 39 (1 & (2 c, d) of the Financial Administration Regulation L.I 1802 requires that:
    </p>
    <p>
        (1) A head of department shall ensure that moneys are utilized in a manner that secures both optimum 
        value for money and the intention of Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
        (2) The head of the accounts section of a department shall control the disbursements of funds and ensure that (c) transactions are
        properly authenticated to show that amounts are due and payable; and (d) any order for disbursements that does not meet these requirements 
        is rejected.
    </p>
        
    <h6>Condition</h6>
    <p>
        Management made several payments to staff mostly management members in respect of official travels without any 
        documents to back/support their claim of travelling.
    </p>

    <h6>Cause</h6>
    <p>
        Management claimed this meetings were through verbal invitations.
    </p>
    <h6>Effect</h6>
    <p>
        Failure to produce the relevant documents/invitation makes the claims unsubstantiated and could lead to abuse in the management
        of resources of {{ data.facility_name | title }}. Again, this practice if not checked could lead to payments of activities not 
        undertaken but a means to create and share resulting in a loss of funds to the facility.
    </p>
    <h6>Recommendation</h6>
    <p>
        We recommend that management should provide evidence of invitation letters, minutes or reports of such meetings for 
        authentication failure which the beneficiaries should refund the amount or the authorizing and approving officers should 
        be surcharged with the amount involved.
