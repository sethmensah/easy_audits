    <h6>Criteria</h6>
    <p>
        Part II paragraph 39(2c) of F.A.R 2004 L.I 1802 requires that the head of   accounts section of a department shall control the 
        disbursement of funds and ensure that transactions are properly authenticated to show that amounts are due and payable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Section D1: (Processing Payments, Procedures/Steps to Follow 1) of the ATF states that “the receipt of a certified SRA, 
        Activity and Expenditure Initiation Form and an Invoice from a certifying officer is essentially the first step in the payment process.
        It is the responsibility of the Head of the Finance Office to review such underlining certifications for legitimacy and completeness before 
        approving the preparation of a Departmental Payment Voucher.
    </p>
        
    <h6>Condition</h6>
    <p>
        Notwithstanding these legal and administrative instructions, 61 payments vouchers amounting to GH¢225,089.87 were not supported 
        by source document or partially supported to authenticate the payments. Refer to Appendix ‘C’ for details.
        It is worth noting that most of the payments to suppliers were made with cash and recipients did not acknowledge receipt of the said 
        payments casting a lot of doubt as to the genuineness of the transactions.
    </p>

    <h6>Cause</h6>
    <p>
        These lapses could be ascribed to disregard to financial rules.
    </p>
    <h6>Effect</h6>
    <p>
        The authenticity of those transactions could not be ascertained. Again, this practice could attract adverse audit observations.
    </p>
    <h6>Recommendation</h6>
    <p>
        We recommend that the Management should ensure that the supporting documents are made available for audit inspection. 
        Failure which the amount should be refunded by the authorizing and approving offices and necessary sanction preferred against them.
