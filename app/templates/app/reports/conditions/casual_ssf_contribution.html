    <h6>Criteria</h6>
    <p>
        Section 115(a, b, c) ACT 766 of the National Pension Scheme ACT 2008, requires that all organizations, despite the provisions 
        of any governing rules or an agreement, an employer shall;
    </p>
    <p>
        a.	Provide the administrative and accounting services required to enable a worker join and contribute to a personal
            pension scheme of the employee’s choice;
    </p>
    <p>
        b.	Make appropriate payroll deductions from the monthly salary of a worker who desires to contribute to a personal
            pension scheme and remit the contributions to the approved trustee of the scheme within fourteen days after the end of the
            month of deduction; and
    </p>
    <p>
        c.	Not mingle payroll deductions with the employer’s own funds and where an employer deducts contributions from the 
            salary of a worker the contributions shall be held by the employer in trust until it is remitted to the appropriate approved trustee.
    </p>
            
    <h6>Condition</h6>
    <p>
        Contrary to the above provisions, a total amount of GH¢{{ v }}  being SSF deductions of temporal workers’ salaries of 
        {{ data.facility_name | title }} had not been remitted to SSNIT with details as shown below. 
    </p>

    <h6>Cause</h6>
    <p>
        These lapses occurred as a result of failure on the part of Management to pay SSNIT contributions of their temporary staffs.
    </p>
    <h6>Effect</h6>
    <p>
        1. {{ data.facility_name | title }}  could attract adverse audit findings and sanctions.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. The practice demotivates the staffs.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. {{ data.facility_name | title }} could be taken to court should the staffs become aware of their legal rights. 
    </p>
    <h6>Recommendation</h6>
    <p>
         We recommend that, management should as a matter of urgency pay all outstanding SSNIT contributions of the 
        affected casual / temporary workers and produce evidence of payment for audit verification and authentication.
